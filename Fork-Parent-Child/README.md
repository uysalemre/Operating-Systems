# What is Fork ?
  - Unix Operating Systems use a special function named Fork for creating new processes.
  - For example; when you open your Linux computer all processes start with using fork() from root process.
  - The easy way to understand it is drawing process tree.
  - Example : In parent fork called -> child created | Again fork called -> a new child created |Â From second child fork called -> Now there is a child attached to second child
  - Hierarchy is like : 
    - Root
      - 1 st child 
      - 2 nd child
        - Child of 2nd child

   - Other ways : You can use Semaphores.
